The assignment had a requirement for having 2 maps on the infographic. My first map shows areas that are impervious to rain, increasing flooding risks. The purpose of that map in the infographic is to show that parks are a valuable resource for permeable land for absorbing rain and other runoff.\nThe second map shows hotspots of sightings recorded in the iNaturalist community website. Community sightings of wildlife are historically very skewed and not good identifiers of a species true range, but they are excellent for identifying hotspots of where people go to watch wildlife. The map shows the desnity of observations over a 10 year period.\nI included the rivers in both maps because they are a defining feature of the area.\nThe rest of the background and diagrams were made in Adobe Illustrator either from scratch or by finding free clip art online and modifying it as needed to fit into the style of the infographic.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nLooking back at this several years later, I am still happy overall. I would make different choices regarding the layout of the title and fonts used for it, and I see some slight alignment issues with other text throughout the layout, but nothing that I would consider a catastrophic failure. I really enjoyed mixing creativity with cartography for this project."

Deciding which data types should be included, and which were too much. I was not personally familiar with this area, so it was interesting trying to pick out the important parts of an area that make it recognizable to those familiar with it without that knowledge myself.\nIf I were to make this map now, I would do it differently. There is not really a cohesive theme that ties everything together. The colors are the ecological zones, which don’t really make sense when included with the human oriented information such as the railroad, county boundary in the ocean, and names of towns.\nI was proud when I made this map, as it is one of the first ones I made on my own outside of an assignment. I am glad I have it to look back at as a starting place."

    "text": "Tools Used\n\nArcPro\nUSGS Earth Explorer\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThis poster was created as the final project for my Remote Sensing class at Portland Community College.\n\n\nMethods\nIn class we went through a module where we calculated land cover change using satellite imagery. For the final project I decided to to the same using imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) due to the better resolution.\n\nNAIP\nThe NAIP program aquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the United States and strives to cover each state every 2-3 years. The original imagery products included Red, Green, and Blue bands of imagery, and NIR imagery was added starting in 2003. This allows for the creation of Color Infrared (CIR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nHaving completed this project several years ago, I’ve identified a major issue in my methodology. When we completed our module using satellite imagery, we were using Landsat U.S. Analysis Ready Data (ARD). This data has already gone through rigorous processing. NAIP imagery is still at an unprocessed level where the pixel values are Digital Numbers (DN) corresponding to the intensity of the measured value on the sensor at time of collection, but do not take into account differing lighting conditions, etc. that may impact those values.\nBelow are links to several papers covering possible ways to normalize NAIP and aerial imagery.\n\n\nResearch Papers\n\nZhang H, Zimba PV, Nzewi EU.

I wanted to create an ArcPro style that mimicked the individual paint strokes used by artists such as Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. At first glance I thought this would be a relatively simple step. I planned to create a seamless pattern in Photoshop and bring it into ArcPro as a fill opiton.\nI learned that I am not the best at making seamless tiles and after 7 “experiments” I chose to move on to trying to make an svg file in Illustrator. This also failed to work properly, so in the end I used the generic point marker in ArcPro and modified it to create different sizes of markers. I ended up using 9-10 different sizes/colors of shape markers to create dynamic variation in the map.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI really enjoyed the experimentation required for completing this project, and I learned a lot about using ArcPro, Photoshop, and Illustrator during this project."
