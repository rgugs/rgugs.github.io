  <title>Making a 2025 FOSS4GNA Graph Map</title>

<p>Check out the the README on Github for the full project explanation.</p>
<p>There are over 120 and workshops and talks at the 2025 FOSS4GNA Conference in Reston, VA (November 3-5), and the content system limits submitting talk and workshops into a single track when they often fit multiple tracks. I wanted a better understanding of the options, so I decided to do some extra visualization. This was also my first time using Claude AI for coding.</p>
<section id="filters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>While pretty, the number of options is overwhelming for useful visualization. The filters allow you to narrow down the visible talks/presentations. This graph doesn’t include the times of the talks, so you’ll need to go to https://www.foss4gna.org/schedule or search on the Whova app to find the times.</p>
</section>
<section id="date" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="date">Date</h2>
<p>The conference runs November 3-5. The workshops are all on November 3rd, and the 4th and 5th are all talks. Use this filter to filter by day.</p>
</section>
<section id="tracks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tracks">Tracks</h2>
<p>There are designated tracks, including GeoAI/ML, Data Management &amp; Interoperability, Use Cases &amp; Applications, etc. These are the official tracks of the talks and can be used to narrow down the schedule view on the official FOSS4GNA Schedule. Selecting this filter will only show the talks/workshops included in the selected track. To see other presentations that may aslo fit in this category, use the Tags filter instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="tags" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tags">Tags</h2>
<p>When applying to present, you can only choose a single track, however there may be multiple tracks applicable for that talk/workshop. Claude AI was used to analyze the submitted descriptions and abstracts and applied up to 3 other possible tracks as tags. Use the Tags filter to find presentations in your desired topic that aren’t included in that specific track.</p>

<p>While designing my personal business cards I decided I wanted to have a QR Code on it leading to this website. I had issues in the past with other QR code generators setting time limits on their functionality and they also pose a security risk, so I decided to make my own. I followed several tutorials using the qrcode and PIL libraries.</p>
<p>I styled each QR code differently to ensure I could tell them apart, and used Landsat Imagery as the background images.</p>

<p>This project is based off <a href="https://youtu.be/ec8vSKJuZTk">this</a> Youtube video, however I diverged significantly from the actual code and logic used based on myprevious coding experience with Python, reading a lot of documentation, and help from Reddit.</p>
<p>I watched and coded along with the first part of the video, but once I started to get used to the syntax of the language I stopped watching it because I learn best by figuring out things on my own by finding solutions using Google, Code Pen, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>As a student at Portland Community College, my advisor recommended me for a lightning talk at the March 2020 PDX Cartography Symposium.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>I was inspired by the Pointillism movement of the late 1880s. I wanted to create an ArcPro style that mimicked the individual paint strokes used by artists such as Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. At first glance I thought this would be a relatively simple step. I planned to create a seamless pattern in Photoshop and bring it into ArcPro as a fill opiton.</p>
<p>I learned that I am not the best at making seamless tiles and after 7 “experiments” I chose to move on to trying to make an svg file in Illustrator. This also failed to work properly, so in the end I used the generic point marker in ArcPro and modified it to create different sizes of markers. I ended up using 9-10 different sizes/colors of shape markers to create dynamic variation in the map.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed the experimentation required for completing this project, and I learned a lot about using ArcPro, Photoshop, and Illustrator during this project.</p>

<p>In class we went through a module where we calculated land cover change using satellite imagery. For the final project I decided to to the same using imagery from the <a href="https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/">National Agriculture Imagery Program</a> (NAIP) due to the better resolution.</p>
<section id="naip" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naip">NAIP</h4>
<p>The NAIP program aquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the United States and strives to cover each state every 2-3 years. The original imagery products included Red, Green, and Blue bands of imagery, and NIR imagery was added starting in 2003. This allows for the creation of Color Infrared (CIR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products.</p>

<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Having completed this project several years ago, I’ve identified a major issue in my methodology. When we completed our module using satellite imagery, we were using Landsat U.S. Analysis Ready Data (ARD). This data has already gone through rigorous processing. NAIP imagery is still at an unprocessed level where the pixel values are Digital Numbers (DN) corresponding to the intensity of the measured value on the sensor at time of collection, but do not take into account differing lighting conditions, etc. that may impact those values.</p>
<p>Below are links to several papers covering possible ways to normalize NAIP and aerial imagery.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I created this infographic in my cartography class that was part of my GIS certificate from <a href="https://www.pcc.edu/programs/gis/">Portland Community College</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>I created the maps using ArcPro. The assignment had a requirement for having 2 maps on the infographic. My first map shows areas that are impervious to rain, increasing flooding risks. The purpose of that map in the infographic is to show that parks are a valuable resource for permeable land for absorbing rain and other runoff.</p>
<p>The second map shows hotspots of sightings recorded in the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> community website. Community sightings of wildlife are historically very skewed and not good identifiers of a species true range, but they are excellent for identifying hotspots of where people go to watch wildlife. The map shows the desnity of observations over a 10 year period.</p>
<p>I included the rivers in both maps because they are a defining feature of the area.</p>
<p>The rest of the background and diagrams were made in Adobe Illustrator either from scratch or by finding free clip art online and modifying it as needed to fit into the style of the infographic.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Looking back at this several years later, I am still happy overall. I would make different choices regarding the layout of the title and fonts used for it, and I see some slight alignment issues with other text throughout the layout, but nothing that I would consider a catastrophic failure. I really enjoyed mixing creativity with cartography for this project.</p>
