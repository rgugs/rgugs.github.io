Check out the the README on Github for the full project explanation.

There are over 120 and workshops and talks at the 2025 FOSS4GNA Conference in Reston, VA (November 3-5), and the content system limits submitting talk and workshops into a single track when they often fit multiple tracks. I wanted a better understanding of the options, so I decided to do some extra visualization. This was also my first time using Claude AI for coding.

## Filters

While pretty, the number of options is overwhelming for useful visualization. The filters allow you to narrow down the visible talks/presentations. This graph doesn't include the times of the talks, so you'll need to go to https://www.foss4gna.org/schedule or search on the Whova app to find the times.

## Date

The conference runs November 3-5. The workshops are all on November 3rd, and the 4th and 5th are all talks. Use this filter to filter by day.

## Tracks

There are designated tracks, including GeoAI/ML, Data Management & Interoperability, Use Cases & Applications, etc. These are the official tracks of the talks and can be used to narrow down the schedule view on the official FOSS4GNA Schedule. Selecting this filter will only show the talks/workshops included in the selected track. To see other presentations that may aslo fit in this category, use the Tags filter instead. 

## Tags

When applying to present, you can only choose a single track, however there may be multiple tracks applicable for that talk/workshop. Claude AI was used to analyze the submitted descriptions and abstracts and applied up to 3 other possible tracks as tags. Use the Tags filter to find presentations in your desired topic that aren't included in that specific track.
