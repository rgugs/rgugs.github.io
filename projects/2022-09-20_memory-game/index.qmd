## Under Construction

I recently moved my website from a vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript website to the Quarto Static Site Generator. I have not migrated this project to work on this website yet. Check back for updates soon, but until then, here is a screenshot of the board.

### Tools Used
* VS Code
* HTML
* Vanilla Javascript
* CSS

### Purpose
I was already relatively familiar with HTML and CSS, so I decided to start learning Javascript through making games.

### Methods
This project is based off [this](https://youtu.be/ec8vSKJuZTk) Youtube video, however I diverged significantly 
from the actual code and logic used based on myprevious coding experience with Python, reading a lot of documentation,
and help from Reddit. 

I watched and coded along with the first part of the video, but once I started to get used to the 
syntax of the language I stopped watching it because I learn best by figuring out things on my own by finding solutions 
using Google, Code Pen, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.

### Final Thoughts
I enjoyed making this game and did help me get familiar with Javascript, but I still need to do more work to actually learn the language.
