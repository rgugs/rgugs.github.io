## Tools Used
* VS Code
* Python Libraries
  * qrcode
  * PIL

## Purpose
While designing my personal business cards I decided I wanted to have a QR Code on it leading to this website. I had issues in the past with other QR code generators setting time limits on their functionality and they also pose a security risk, so I decided to make my own. I followed several tutorials using the qrcode and PIL libraries.

I styled each QR code differently to ensure I could tell them apart, and used Landsat Imagery as the background images.

## Results
### Website QR Code

### Contacts QR code
Due to security issues, this QR code does not include my actual contact information.
